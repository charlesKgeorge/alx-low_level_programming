# General
* Used editor *vi*
* All files compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using `gcc`, using the options `-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89`
* All your files end with a new line
* A *README.md* file, at the root of the folder of the project is mandatory
* Your code should use the `Betty` style. It will be checked using `betty-style.pl` and `betty-doc.pl`
* You are not allowed to use global variables
* No more than 5 functions per file
* You are not allowed to use the standard library. Any use of functions like printf, puts, etc… is forbidden
* You are allowed to use `_putchar`
* The prototypes of all your functions and the prototype of the function _putchar are included in your header file called main.h

# Files
