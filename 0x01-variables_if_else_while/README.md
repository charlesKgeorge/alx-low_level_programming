# 0x01-variables_if_else_while
Will contain C files to further understand and master the C programming language specifically on variables and loops and all the other syntax applied to create these loops e.g operators, incrementing, decrementing etc

# Requirements
## C files
- Used editor: *vi*
- All your files will be compiled on **Ubuntu 20.04 LTS** using **gcc**, using the options *-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89*
- All your files should end with a new line
- A *README.md* file at the root of the repo, containing a description of the repository
- A README.md file, at the root of the folder of this project, containing a description of the project
- There should be no errors and no warnings during compilation
- You are not allowed to use *system*
- Your code should use the *Betty* style. It will be checked using *betty-style.pl* and *betty-doc.pl*
